                Training for the use of CSS-MedAid started 4<sup>th</sup> March, 2019 at about 9am at GA-West Municipal Hospital.<br> The hospital was not using any application and it was found necessary to use one.<p> Team members of CODESEC SOLUTIONS (Millicent, Gordon and Nii Sowah) were present at the facility to commence and support the training process. Training was done as per schedule but holiday (6<sup>th,</sup> March, 2019) and occasional day-off (15<sup>th</sup> and 22<sup>nd</sup> March, 2019) for other duties interrupted the process.
